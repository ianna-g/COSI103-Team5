<h4>Purpose:</h4>
<p> This website uses chat GPT to take in a bible verse as the input and return the output
which would be the content of the bible verse.</p>
<p>If users want to reference the bible verses that they initially researched, they can always use 
    Saved button which would redirect them to proviously saved content. 
</p>

<br>
<h4>How it works:</h4>
<p> When the user types in a scripture, chat GPT will spit out the words that correspond to the scripture that was input.</p>
<p> Remember to include the name of the book, the chapter in which the verse is found and the verse itself. Please separagte the 
    chapter number from the verses using the colon(:) symbol. Feel free to ask chat gpt to output a range of verses by separating 
    the verses by a "-". The format of your responses should be "John 3:16".
