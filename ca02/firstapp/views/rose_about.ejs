    This webapp uses the NLP Cloud API that is based on GPT. Given text with grammatical errors<br />
    the app creates grammatically correct text. The user
    can then<br />
    navigate to "Previous Queries" where they can click on a text that was
    corrected, and view<br />
    the correction.<br />
    <br />
    Heres how it works:
    <br />
    1. get incorrect text from user<br />
    2. connect to the NLP Cloud API and send the prompt<br />
    4. await response from API<br />
    5. create a Mongodb document using input, output, and the user's id<br />
    6. save the Mongodb document to the database<br />
    <br />
    When a user clicks on a previous query...<br />
    1. a query is made to find the text that is stored in the database<br />
    2. once the text is found by its id, the page is directed to a new page
    with the correction for the text
